				<h2><span>Enabling</span> Art</h2>
				<p>
					ARC is a render cluster that is free to use by any 3D
					artist.  Our goal is to provide free, high power computing
					resources to artists anywhere.  We plan to support Blender
					and LuxRender.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our mission is to be completely free to use, however running
					the cluster will not be free.  To support this project,
					please consider a donation.  Your contributions will help get
					the project off the ground!

				<h2><span>About </span>Arc</h2>
				<p>
					ARC Render Cluster is a free render cluster designed to help
					artists around the world realize their 3D projects without
					having to maintain an expensive overhead.
				</p>
				<p>
					At ARC, our mission is to enable art, not censor it.  Because
					of this, you will notice that the only restriction we place
					is that your art must be legal.  Other than that, you are
					free to render whatever you would like.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will also notice that we do not offer any priority
					access to the cluster, compute time is served on a first
					come first serve basis.  We do this as a matter of fairness.
					It would be unfair to allow someone to occupy the cluster
					while other artists get only what remains.
				</p>
				<h2><span>About Funding</span></h2>
				<p>
					ARC is free to use.
					We do this as a matter of access, we do not want money to be
					a factor in the success of art.  This cluster, however, is 
					not free to operate.  There are costs incurred for the
					bandwidth needed, the power, and the hardware used to run
					the cluster.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rather than charge for service, we rely on contributions
					from those who can and are willing to contribute to the
					project.  If you are able to contribute, and you find
					ARC useful, please consider a donation to keep this service
					freely available.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also use revenue from the ads we run on this site to fund
					the project.  We use non-intrusive ads that only display on
					the left side of the screen, they do not interrupt content,
					take up more space than the left side of the page, or force
					you to interact with them.
				</p>
				<h2><span>Nitty Gritty</span></h2>
				<p>
					ARC is a cluster that is based on free and open source
					software.  We do this because the philosophy of free,
					universal, and unrestricted access is what drives the work
					behind ARC.  All of the software that ARC uses is open
					source and available on <a href="https://github.com/akester/arc-render-cluster/">
					Git Hub</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The render cluster hardware is based on various platforms
					that offer us the most efficient cost and density.  Currently,
					we boast 8 systems in 3 units of space.  Eventually, the
					goal is to design or use an open source hardware platform,
					but currently the cost and complexity of such a system is
					too great for this project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our servers also help others in any way we can, from hosting
					mirrors to seeding torrents of Linux Distributions, to 
					donating unused CPU cycles to Folding At Home, our mission
					is to help people even if someone isn't rendering on the
					cluster.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the future, we think it would be sweet to offer access
					to the cluster to run cluster jobs that you might have.
					Eventually, we hope to have such acces.

					<h2>Project Status</h2>
					<p>
						We'll keep you posted about the latest project happenings
						here.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, we are still writing the web interface to the
						cluster.  We have a development cluster set up and it is
						working with the files tested so far.  What is left is
						we need to integrate it into the web interface and put
						in more tracking to allow users to cancel jobs and know
						how much cpu, memory, etc their job used.

				<h2>Helping Others</h2>
				<p>
					Our mission is to help others in any way that we can.  We
					are building ARC to help artists, but we will 
					donate any remaining
					compute power to charities such as Folding at Home.  Even
					if you aren't using the cluster, it still is helping others.
